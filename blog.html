                <ul>
			<li>This assignment was easy once I figured out how to use github. The only issues I had was remembering what was supposed to be typed at the top before the html tag, what I now know is the DOCTYPE thing and getting my image of myself to show up. All it took was simple google searches to figure the problems out though.</li>
			<li>I learned how to do a couple things with github from this assignment. I didnt learn much from the assignment itself. I mostly just messed with what we already learned in lecture. But it is always satisfying to do something and see it completed how you had wanted and expected it to be.</li>
			<li>A few resources I used were google, to search a couple issues I had, and piazza to confirm what a turned in assignment should look like, and just to see what problems other students were having.</li>
