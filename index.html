            <li>My name is Cameron Culp, call me whatever you feel like.</li>
            <li>My major is Computer Science, and this is my second year of study.</li>
            <li>My web development skills are probably around a 3. I know basic HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn webpage design skills, javascript, and mysql.</li>
            <li>Yes, I am signed up for a Piazza account.</li>
            <li>Hmm, I guess the first thing people question about me is why I always wear a black hoodie with the hood up<br>
            everywhere I go, even if its super hot out. I had a haircut so bad about 4 years ago that I kept my coat on for<br>
            about 1 month to let my hair grow out for a new haircut, and I kept wearing it even after, with no real reason
            any time I go out in public, its on 95% of times.</li>
